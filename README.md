Reload the web app on Pythonanywhere
=================================

Pythonanywhere is a good place to host your web app, and I like it very much.
But everytime when I made some changes. I have to open up the browser, tap on the 'Web' tab and Press the Reload button. I think it's waste of time.
So I made a script to do all the works. And of course it's written in Python!!

## Usage ##
1. Fill up the USERNAME and PASSWORD in reload.py.
